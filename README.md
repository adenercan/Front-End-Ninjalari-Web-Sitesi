# Front-End-Ninjalari-Web-Sitesi
A collaborative project created by a three-person team to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We apply concepts learned in class to a real web interface, focusing on responsive design, clean structure, interactive elements, and teamwork in a shared development workflow.
