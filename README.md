# Front-End-Ninjalari-Web-Sitesi-Portfolio

This is the first team project for our 3-person developer team, built to put our class learning into practice. As students currently in the learning phase of our software development journey, we developed this 6-page responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
